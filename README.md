## Tidy dataset

The script "run_analysis.R" creates a tidy dataset from the  
"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" 
(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
It is assumed that the file has already been downloaded and extracted, and that the 
R working directory if set to the extracted dataset.

The script is described in details in the file "CodeBook.md"
